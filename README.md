# Battleship Engine

Dynamic React.js webapp that serves as an interface for a game engine for the strategic guessing board game Battleship / Sea Battle, designed to find an optimal 
move based on known information available to the player.

Uses React functional components and React hooks (useState, useEffect) and css flexbox to build and style the webapp.

Applies an algorithm written in Javascript that calculates the probability density of ship positions based on superposition of all remaining possible positions.
